# GA Github Class

## Signing Up

Before we get into the awesomeness of GitHub, we all need to sign up.

Head to [github.com](https://github.com), click `Sign Up` and follow the directions to set up your account.

## Lesson Planning and Organization

Nick and I use GitHub to manage all our lessons.  It gives all the students read access to every lesson we teach, organized by week.  Each class block links to the lesson itself.  And all those lessons?  They're in GitHub, too.

<!-- show the wdi-2 schedule and maybe a little MD -->

## Sharing Code

>"Good artists copy.  Great artists steal." -Pablo Picasso or Steve Jobs or Something

- Navigate to this repo if you haven't already.  `https://github.com/ZebGirouard/GA-github-class`
- Click the `Clone or download` button and select `Download ZIP`.
- Unzip the file you just downloaded.
- Go into the expanded folder and double-click the `index.html` file.
- OMG webpage!  You're a web developer.

<!--If time go into dev tools and tweak the page -->

## We're in the Cloud!

Another cool GitHub feature is GitHub Pages.  This allows you to make your website public, so you can share the page as well as the code.  And the best part: it's completely free!

Go to https://zebgirouard.github.io/GA-github-class/, and you will see the same site you just downloaded.
